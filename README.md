# Movies_MVP
Very Simple App to know the consept of MVP

# MVC Pattern

Model: The model will continue to contain the data in simple classes, so nothing really changes here.

View: The view will continue to be implemented using Activity or Fragment classes, but we will change the scope of what the view controls.

Presenter: The last part is the presenter, which handles UI updates based on changes to the data model, and also processes users inputs. The presenter will contain much of the business code and replaces the controller from MVC.
